# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

For a local repository, you first have to create or navigate to the directory you want use on your local machine.  You would create the file using `touch` command in the terminal.  Then you would use `git init` to initialize git in that directory.  The workflow, after git is initialize, is to 1. `git add <filename>`, then `git commit -m "Initial commit" - press return.  

On gitHub.com, you have options to create a repository.  Create a name for the github repository that matches local machine, then press the "create repository" button.  Make sure the SSH buton is selected and select/copy the functions you want to perfor.  For example, "push" means that we will take the work which is save on local computer and push it to the github repository.  Once that is done, the repository is "remote".
